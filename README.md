# Advent of Code
:christmas_tree:

Annual Advent Calendar with code puzzels.

## Personal goals
Try to get it right at the first attempt! =)

This is my personal archive of all my solved puzzles.

## Prequisities
I try to solve the puzzles solely a the browser console.

So you need:
- a browser loaded with a browser console
- the page with the input

## Tips
- use the example code blocks
```javascript
input = document.getSelection().focusNode.innerText.split('\n').filter(l => l.length);
```

## Status
On a roll for 2022, try catch-up with past years... Joined december 2022...
