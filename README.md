# Advent of Code
:christmas_tree:

Annual Advent Calendar with code puzzels.

## Personal goals
Try to get it right at the first attempt! =)

This is my personal archive of all my solved puzzles.

## Prequisities
I try to solve the puzzles solely a the browser console.

So you need:
- a browser loaded with a browser console
- the page with the input

## Tips
- copy/paste the example code blocks
```javascript
input = 'copied\n\
contents'.split('\n');
```
