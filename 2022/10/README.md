I liked this one very much.

Took a hardware kind of approach.
- a cycle clock
- a CPU
- a assembler
- a monitoring tool
- a measurement tool
- a CRT with scanner
- start the clock to initiate everything

## part one: monitor the cycles
[part-1.js](part-1.js)

## part two: crt scanning
[part-2.js](part-2.js)
